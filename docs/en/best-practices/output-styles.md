title: Output Style Strategy

# Output Style Strategy

Output styles are high-priority system prompts, suitable for defining team standards, coding standards, and AI behavior guidelines. By configuring different output styles, you can control AI assistant personality and working methods.

## What is Output Style

Output styles are Markdown files stored in the `prompts/output-style/` directory, defining AI assistant's:

- 🎭 **Personality Traits**: AI's speaking style and behavior
- 📝 **Coding Standards**: Code style, comment requirements, naming conventions
- ✅ **Quality Standards**: Code review standards, testing requirements
- 🔍 **Working Methods**: Problem analysis methods, decision processes

## Management Methods

### Install Output Styles

Specify styles to install via `--output-styles` parameter during initialization:

```bash
# Install all output styles
npx zcf init -o all

# Install specific styles
npx zcf init -o engineer-professional,nekomata-engineer

# Skip output style installation
npx zcf init -o skip
```

### Switch Output Style

#### Switch in Main Menu

```bash
npx zcf
# Select 6 (Configure AI Memory & Output Style)
# Then select output style management
```

#### Switch in Project

**Claude Code**:
```
/set-output-style engineer-professional
```

**Codex**:
Edit `systemPromptStyle` in `config.toml` or use system prompt configuration.

### Edit Output Style

Output style files are located in `prompts/output-style/` directory:

```bash
# View installed styles
ls -la ~/.claude/prompts/output-style/

# Edit specific style
vim ~/.claude/prompts/output-style/engineer-professional.md

# Create custom style
vim ~/.claude/prompts/output-style/my-custom-style.md
```

## Pre-configured Output Styles

ZCF provides the following pre-configured output styles:

| Style ID | Name | Features | Use Case |
|---------|------|------|---------|
| `engineer-professional` | Professional Engineer | Rigorous, professional, focuses on code quality | Formal projects, enterprise environments |
| `nekomata-engineer` | Nekomata Engineer | Light and friendly, maintains professionalism | Personal projects, relaxed atmosphere |
| `laowang-engineer` | Laowang Engineer | Humorous and down-to-earth, direct and effective | Chinese projects, domestic teams |
| `ojousama-engineer` | Ojousama Engineer | Elegant and refined, focuses on details | Specific scenarios, stylized projects |

### Built-in Output Styles

In addition to pre-configured styles, the following built-in styles are also supported (always available):

- `default`: Default output style
- `explanatory`: Explanatory style, focuses on detailed explanation
- `learning`: Learning style, focuses on teaching and explanation

## Practice Recommendations

### 1. Write Team Standards into Output Style

Output style is an ideal place to define team development standards:

```markdown
# ~/.claude/prompts/output-style/team-standards.md

## Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript, strict mode
- Functions no more than 50 lines
- Must write unit tests
- Use ESLint and Prettier
- Follow SOLID principles

## Code Review Requirements

- All PRs must go through code review
- Ensure test coverage > 80%
- Check performance impact
- Verify security
```

### 2. Create Multiple Styles for On-Demand Switching

Create different output styles for different scenarios:

```bash
# During development: Use professional engineer style
/set-output-style engineer-professional

# During code review: Use review-specific style
/set-output-style code-review

# During documentation: Use documentation style
/set-output-style documentation
```

### 3. Project-Specific Styles

For projects requiring independent styles, use project-level output styles:

```
# Create in project root directory
Project Root/.claude/output-style/project-specific.md

# Use in conversation
/set-output-style project-specific
```

Project-specific styles override global styles but only take effect in that project.

### 4. Style Priority

Output style priority:

1. **Project-Specific Style** (`.claude/output-style/` or `.codex/output-style/`)
2. **Global Default Style** (default settings in `~/.claude/prompts/output-style/`)
3. **Built-in Style** (`default`, `explanatory`, `learning`)

### 5. Version Control

Include team output styles in version control:

```bash
# Create team style repository
mkdir team-output-styles
cp ~/.claude/prompts/output-style/team-standards.md team-output-styles/

# Include in Git
git add team-output-styles/
git commit -m "Add team output style standards"

# Team member sync
git pull
cp team-output-styles/team-standards.md ~/.claude/prompts/output-style/
```

## Output Style Structure

Typical output style file structure:

```markdown
# Output Style Name

## Personality Traits
Describe AI's speaking style and behavior

## Coding Standards
- Code style requirements
- Naming conventions
- Comment requirements

## Quality Standards
- Code review standards
- Testing requirements
- Performance standards

## Working Methods
- Problem analysis methods
- Decision processes
- Collaboration methods
```

## Custom Output Styles

### Create Custom Style

1. **Create Style File**:
```bash
vim ~/.claude/prompts/output-style/my-style.md
```

2. **Write Style Content**:
```markdown
# My Custom Style

You are a professional full-stack engineer, focusing on:
- Code quality and maintainability
- Performance optimization
- Security considerations
- User experience

## Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript
- Follow Airbnb code standards
- Write complete type definitions
- Must include error handling

## Working Methods
- Understand requirements before coding
- Write tests for test-driven development
- Focus on code reuse
- Continuous refactoring and optimization
```

3. **Use Custom Style**:
```bash
# Set default style
npx zcf
# Select 6, then select my-style

# Or use in project
/set-output-style my-style
```

### Team Shared Styles

Share custom styles with team:

```bash
# 1. Export style file
cp ~/.claude/prompts/output-style/team-style.md ./team-styles/

# 2. Include in version control
git add team-styles/
git commit -m "Add team output style"

# 3. Team members import
git pull
cp team-styles/team-style.md ~/.claude/prompts/output-style/
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Layered Definition of Standards

- **Global Style**: Team-common coding standards and standards
- **Project Style**: Project-specific requirements and constraints
- **Role Style**: Styles for different roles (developer, reviewer, document writer)

### 2. Keep Styles Concise

Output styles should be concise and clear, avoid being too verbose:

- ✅ **Recommended**: Core standards and key requirements
- ❌ **Not Recommended**: Overly detailed details (should be in project documentation)

### 3. Regular Style Updates

As projects develop and teams grow, regularly update output styles:

```bash
# Regular review and update
vim ~/.claude/prompts/output-style/engineer-professional.md

# Update after team discussion
git add prompts/output-style/
git commit -m "Update output style standards"
```

### 4. Test Style Effects

After creating new style, test its effects:

```bash
# 1. Set new style
/set-output-style my-new-style

# 2. Conduct test conversation
Please help me implement a simple Todo feature

# 3. Evaluate if output meets expectations

# 4. Adjust style based on feedback
```

### 5. Document Styles

Write documentation for custom styles:

```markdown
# team-standards.md

## Style Description

This style defines our team's development standards and quality standards.

## Usage Scenarios

- Formal project development
- Code review
- Technical review

## Update History

- 2025-01-15: Initial version
- 2025-02-01: Added performance requirements
```

## Notes

### Claude Code Version Requirements

- ⚠️ **Version Requirement**: Claude Code version must be > 1.0.81 to support output styles
- ✅ **Check Version**: Use `npx zcf check-updates` to check and update
- 📝 **Migration Note**: Global memory rules from old versions have been migrated to `engineer-professional` style

### Style File Locations

- **Claude Code**: `~/.claude/prompts/output-style/`
- **Codex**: `~/.codex/prompts/output-style/` (if supported)
- **Project Level**: `.claude/output-style/` or `.codex/output-style/`

### Style Conflict Handling

If multiple styles exist simultaneously:

1. Project-level style takes priority
2. Global default style is next
3. Built-in style as fallback
